<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>This is a template app. Here are covered some basics of oTree.</p>

<p>
    First of all, oTree is based on the Django framework.
    As such, it contains the typical Django project files (models.py, urls.py, and various html pages or templates...).
    Html pages are contained in the folder "name_app/templates".

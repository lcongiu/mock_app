{% extends "global/Page.html" %}
{% load otree static %}

As anticipated below, each oTree page extends "global/Page.html", that extends "global/Base.html".
Below an excerpt of Base.html, so to have an idea of what it contains:

Among other things, Base.html contains the meta tag
<!--<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">-->
and link to bootstrap css
<!--<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'bootstrap4/css/bootstrap.min.css' %}">-->
This means that oTree comes with Bootstrap 4 and that its Apps are responsive, by default.

The css files of Bootstrap are in the local folder: "External Libraries/Python 3.7/site-packages/otree/static/bootstrap4/css/".
Similarly, oTree specific css can be found here: "External Libraries/Python 3.7/site-packages/otree/static/otree/css/"
These files should NOT be modified, rather overwritten either in the global style.css mentioned above, or
directly in the App html page through the tags <!--<style></style>-->, or both.

oTree classes mirror those of Bootstrap 4. Specifically:
* "otree-body" is the equivalent of "body"
* "container" is a general container
* By default, the main container of a page is "otree-body container", which takes the values of both the above classes
* "otree-btn-next" is the equivalent of "btn-next"; it manages the next button

Divs using these classes are automatically created with the App page.
The html code responsible for this is contained in Page.html, mentioned above.
Below, a short excerpt of Page.html:

<!--
<div class="otree-body container">
        <h2 class="otree-title page-header">...</h2>
            <div class="otree-form-errors alert alert-danger">
-->

This means that any App page will contain both the code of Base.html (specifically, html structure and link to bootstrap),
a div of class "otree-body container", and a button of class "otree-btn-next", needed to advance to the subsequent page.

{% block content %}

<h2>Integration with Bootstrap</h2>
<p>
    If we inspect the html of this or any other page, we will see that the code links to a boostrap css file
    (see the file /templates/mock_app/Bootstrap.html for details).
    This means that oTree is natively integrated with Bootstrap 4.
</p>

<p>Specifically, it implies that oTree:</p>
<ol>
    <li>is natively responsive, i.e. its elements scale with screen width</li>
    <li>supports built-in Bootstrap classes ("container", "btn-primary", etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, if you try to resize this page, you will see that this content shrinks to fit the screen width.</p>
<p>
    If you inspect the code of this page, you will see that the content of this page has been encapsulated
    into a div of class "otree-body container". This occurs by default, and serves as the html body.
    The class "container" is one of the main classes of bootstrap, and is responsive by default.
</p>

<p>
    Again, you should refer to the customization of this class in the file style.css.
    But you can also customize it in the html code of the page of interest, as will be shown in a second.
</p>

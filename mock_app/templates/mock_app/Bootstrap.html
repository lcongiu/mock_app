As anticipated below, each oTree page extends "global/Page.html", that extends "global/Base.html".
Below an excerpt of Base.html, so to have an idea of what it contains:

Among other things, Base.html contains the meta tag
<!--<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">-->
and link to bootstrap css
<!--<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'bootstrap4/css/bootstrap.min.css' %}">-->
This means that oTree comes with Bootstrap 4 and that its Apps are responsive, by default.

The css files of Bootstrap are in the local folder: "External Libraries/Python 3.7/site-packages/otree/static/bootstrap4/css/".
Similarly, oTree specific css can be found here: "External Libraries/Python 3.7/site-packages/otree/static/otree/css/"
These files should NOT be modified, rather overwritten either in the global style.css mentioned above, or
directly in the App html page through the tags <!--<style></style>-->, or both.

oTree classes mirror those of Bootstrap 4. Specifically:
* "otree-body" is the equivalent of "body"
* "container" is a general container
* By default, the main container of a page is "otree-body container", which takes the values of both the above classes
* "otree-btn-next" is the equivalent of "btn-next"; it manages the next button

Divs using these classes are automatically created with the App page.
The html code responsible for this is contained in Page.html, mentioned above.
Below, a short excerpt of Page.html:

<!--
<div class="otree-body container">
        <h2 class="otree-title page-header">...</h2>
            <div class="otree-form-errors alert alert-danger">
-->

This means that any App page will contain both the code of Base.html (specifically, html structure and link to bootstrap),
a div of class "otree-body container", and a button of class "otree-btn-next", needed to advance to the subsequent page.

<h2>Integration with Bootstrap</h2>
<p>
    If we inspect the html of this or any other page, we will see that the code links to a boostrap css file
    (see the file /templates/mock_app/Bootstrap.html for details).
    This means that oTree is natively integrated with Bootstrap 4.
</p>

<br>

<h5>Bootstrap and oTree</h5>
<p>The integration with Bootstrap implies two main things.</p>
<p> First, oTree is natively responsive, i.e. its elements scale with screen width.
    For example, if you try to resize this page, you will see that this content shrinks to fit the screen width.
</p>
<p>
    Second, oTree supports built-in Bootstrap classes ("container", "btn-primary", etc.).
    If you inspect the code of this page, you will see that the content of this page has been encapsulated
    into a div of class "otree-body container". This occurs by default, and serves as the html body.
    The class "container" is one of the main classes of bootstrap, and is responsive by default.
</p>
<p>
    Again, you should refer to the customization of "container" in the file _static/global/style.css.
    However, you can also customize this and any other element in the html code of the page of interest,
    through the "style" tag.
</p>

<br>

<h5>Bootstrap grid system</h5>
<p>
    Other important built-in classes of Bootstrap that can be used in oTree are "row" and "col".
    Rows and cols allow to have a better management of the space available,
    and are particularly needed when using multiple containers, especially if aligned on the same row.
</p>
<p>
    Rows and columns form what is called the "grid system".
    Bootstrap subdivides a webpage into 12 columns.
    Hence, if we want to include two columns, each column must take at most 6 "units" out of 12 (more details in
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/#grid-example-basic">this section</a>
    of the official documentation of Bootstrap).
</p>
<p>
    For example, below we included two containers on the same line.
    We first created a "row" div (grey) and we included in it two "col-sm-5" divs (in red).
    The class "col-sm-5" is one of the many classes for column, each with its own width and responsive behavior
    (for details, check the "style" block of this html page or refer to the
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/#grid-options">official documentation</a>).
</p>
<p>
    As explained above, the number expresses the column span, i.e. the units that it covers out of the 12 available.
    Hence, "col-sm-5" will take a width lower than half (we did so to leave some room between the two containers).
    The string "sm" (that stands for "small") determines the behavior of the column as screen width decreases.
    For example, "sm" means each of the two columns will take 5 units only when screen width is equal or above 576px,
    otherwise they align one below the other and take all available width.
    You can check this behavior by resizing the width of this page.
</p>

<div class="row justify-content-around my-4">
<!--"justify-content-around" aligns columns horizontally by leaving the same space between themselves and borders-->
<!--"my-4" controls Margins on the Y-axis and assigns to it the value of "3"-->
    <div class="col-sm-5">This column take 5 units out of 12 available for width.</div>
    <div class="col-sm-5">This column take 5 units out of 12 available for width.</div>
</div>

<p>
    You can use columns to display information in the same row.
    However, mind that a similar but nicer way of doing this is using a "card deck", another feature of Bootstrap
    (<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/#card-decks">official documentation here</a>).
    Below, we use a card deck to display fictional information about a player and her partner's behavior in an experiment.
    Again, check the block style to see how we customized this element.
</p>

<div class="card-deck my-4">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-header">
            <h5 class="card-title">Your performance</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">Score: 5 points</p>
            <p class="card-text">Time: 30 seconds</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-header">
            <h5 class="card-title">Your partner's performance</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">Score: 7 points</p>
            <p class="card-text">Time: 45 seconds</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
